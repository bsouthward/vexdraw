It is written\ncompletely in JavaScript, and runs right in the browser. VexFlow supports HTML5\nCanvas and SVG, and runs on all modern browsers.\n\nGo try out [The VexFlow Tutorial](http://vexflow.com/docs/tutorial.html) to\nlearn how to use VexFlow.\n\nIf you're not a developer and just want to write and share your music, go to\n[My VexFlow](http://my.vexflow.com).\n\n## Quick Start\n\nInstall via NPM:\n\n    $ npm install vexflow\n\nInclude `releases/vexflow-min.js` into your HTML or JS code. It works as a standalone script in a `script` tag, or as a CommonJS or AMD dependency.\n\n## Resources\n\nTo learn and contribute, check out the [VexFlow Wiki](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki).\n\nTo build VexFlow from scratch, read the [Build Instructions](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Build-Instructions).\n\n## MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) Mohit Muthanna Cheppudira 2010 <br/>\n0xFE <mohit@muthanna.com> http://www.vexflow.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
