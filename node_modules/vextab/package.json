  "readme": "# VexTab 2.0\n\nA VexTab Parser for VexFlow.\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mohit Muthanna Cheppudira.\n\n## What is VexTab?\n\nVexTab is a language that allows you to easily create, edit, and share music notation and guitar tablature. Unlike ASCII tab, which is designed for readability, VexTab is designed for writeability.\n\nGo try it out at [The VexTab Tutorial](http://vexflow.com/vextab/tutorial.html).\n\nIf you want to save and share your VexTab, try out [My Vexflow](http://my.vexflow.com).\n\nTo see what VexTab can do, take a look at the [list of features](http://my.vexflow.com/articles/53?source=enabled).\n\n## Quick Start\n\nSimply include `releases/vextab-div.js` into your HTML document via a script tag. The contents of all `div` elements with the class `vex-tabdiv` are parsed as VexTab and automatically rendered in-place as music notation.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"vex-tabdiv\"\n    width=680 scale=1.0 editor=\"true\"\n    editor_width=680 editor_height=330>options space=20\n    tabstave\n    notation=true\n    key=A time=4/4\n\n    notes :q =|: (5/2.5/3.7/4) :8 7-5h6/3 ^3^ 5h6-7/5 ^3^ :q 7V/4 |\n    notes :8 t12p7/4 s5s3/4 :8 3s:16:5-7/5 :h p5/4\n    text :w, |#segno, ,|, :hd, , #tr\n\n\n    options space=25\n</div>\n```\n\nVexTab defaults to HTML5 canvas; for SVG include RaphaelJS in a script tag _before_ `vextab-div.js`. See the `.html` files in `doc/` for examples of `vextab-div` in use.\n\nSome of the available `div` attributes are:\n\n* `editor`: `true`|`false` -- Enable/disable live editor. Default `false`.\n* `scale`: `0.5` -> `3.0` -- Scale factor for rendering. Default `1.0`.\n* `editor_width`, `editor_height`: pixels -- Dimensions of editor.\n\nYou can use the CSS file in `releases/vextab.css` for basic styling of the interface.\n\nNote that the provided `vextab-div.js` bundle is unminified, and includes all necessary dependencies such as jQuery, lodash, and VexFlow. You can get access to some of these classes, and the VexTab API (see below) via the `VexTabDiv` global.\n\n* `VexTabDiv.Div`: The TabDiv class used to implement the auto-render functionality for `div` elements.\n* `VexTabDiv.VexTab`: The parser. See API below.\n* `VexTabDiv.Artist`: The renderer. See API below.\n* `VexTabDiv.Flow`: The `Vex.Flow` namespace from the VexFlow library.\n\n## VexTab API\n\nIf you want to do more interesting things with VexTab, you can use the API directly.\n\n```\n$ npm install vextab\n```\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```js\n// Load VexTab module.\nvextab = require(\"vextab\");\n\nVexTab = vextab.VexTab;\nArtist = vextab.Artist;\nRenderer = vextab.Vex.Flow.Renderer;\n\n// Create VexFlow Renderer from canvas element with id #boo.\nrenderer = new Renderer($('#boo')[0], Renderer.Backends.CANVAS);\n\n// Initialize VexTab artist and parser.\nartist = new Artist(10, 10, 600, {scale: 0.8});\nvextab = new VexTab(artist);\n\ntry {\n    // Parse VexTab music notation passed in as a string.\n    vextab.parse(\"tabstave notation=true\\n notes :q 4/4\\n\")\n\n    // Render notation onto canvas.\n    artist.render(renderer);\n} catch (e) {\n    console.log(e);\n}\n```\n\nSee `tests/playground.js` for a working example of the VexTab API in use.\n\nYou can also also use the API in standalone mode, i.e., without a loader, by including `releases/vextab-div.js` in a `script` tag. See `tests/vextab-standalone.js` for an example of this.\n\n## Developers\n\nClone this repository. Then run the following commands to setup a basic build and run tests:\n\n```\n$ npm install\n$ npm link\n$ npm link vextab\n$ npm start\n```\n\nIf you have the `grunt-cli` NPM package installed, you can manually run the various build steps:\n\n```\n$ npm install -g grunt-cli\n$ grunt (lint|build|test|stage|publish)\n```\n\nBefore sending in a pull request, make sure that the tests pass a visual inspection. Open `tests/runtests.html` in your browser and verify that the notation examples at the bottom of the page render correctly. Also open `tests/playground.html` and verify that your new feature/bug fix, etc. works correctly.\n\nPlease add new tests for whatever you're working on. Don't send PRs without tests. Thanks!\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis rewrite of VexTab has three key dependencies:\n\n  * [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - A *nicer* JavaScript.\n  * [Jison](http://zaach.github.com/jison/) - An LALR(1) parser modeled on Bison.\n  * [lodash](http://lodash.com/) - A utility-belt library for JavaScript.\n\nFor the audio player feature, you need:\n\n  * [MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js) - A soundfont renderer for the web.\n  * Soundfonts for various instruments - See MIDI.js for more information.\n\n## Help\n\nQuestions? Ask the [VexFlow Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/vexflow).\n\n## License\n\nVexTab is an open specification and the reference implementation (this repository) is open source. It is freely available complete and uncrippled for non-commercial use.\n\nIf you would like to use this code on commercial websites, products, blogs, plugins, or tools, please get in touch with me.
